# Installfest Step 2: Mac Development Tools & Applications

## Text Editor

Our class will be using [Atom/Sublime](#TODO-PICK-ONE) as our preferred text editor. Please follow the installation instructions for:
<!-- TODO: PICK ONE -->
* [Atom](editor-atom.md)
* [Sublime Text 3](editor-sublime-text-3.md)

## Browser

* [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?hl=en)

We also recommend you install the following Chrome Extensions:

* <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc" target="_blank">JSON View</a>
* <a href="http://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">Postman</a>

## Window Manager

While programming it's pretty common to need to juggle the placement of multiple windows. To speed up this process, we'll install a program that does this for us (and gives us a bunch of convenient keyboard shortcuts).

1. Download https://raw.github.com/onsi/ShiftIt/master/ShiftIt.zip
    * Next, extract it and drag the application icon into your `Applications` directory.
    * Finally, launch the app by double-clicking the ShiftIt icon and follow the instructions to enable the accessibility options.

2. We recommend you familiarze yourself with ShiftIt commands and keyboard shortcuts, like:
* Move window to the left-half: Command+Option+Control+LeftArrow
* Move window to the right-half: Command+Option+Control+RightArrow
* **M**aximize a window: Command+Option+Control+**M**

You can try this now.

### A word on *Keyboard Shortcuts*

By the way, developers LOVE shortcut key combinations.  All of the shortcut keys listed above have special abbreviations.  If you have time later, you can read about those abbreviations and some shortcut key combinations [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236Ã‚).  You should now see the shiftIt icon in your menu-bar. (at the top)
